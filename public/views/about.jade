            p All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander.

It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.
