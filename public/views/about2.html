          <p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. </p>

          <p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</p>

          <p>I call it luck. He is here. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
